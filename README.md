# cookiedragon234 is cancelled
You've gone too far

### Backstory
For the past couple weeks, ive been cracking backdoored, cookie's client, and he has not liked it. At first he tried changing his key generator, but when that didnt work, he got new obfuscation, para 2.0. But when backdoored 1.8 and 1.8.2 got cracked as well, he had too much.

my leaks are very high quality and prompt to client updates, so cookie decided the only way to prevent my leaks from going in like freethrows, he was going to frame me and attempt to cause distrust to my leaks (logical thing to do, but not ok)

### Bottom line
All of my cracks/leaks are clean, they will never have backdoors or coord leakers, and i encourage you all to reverse engineer my cracks for your own peace of mind. thank you, child.

### p.s.
Above I have released all strings and encrypted method calls in backdoored 1.8.2 so you can look for urls and other such things
